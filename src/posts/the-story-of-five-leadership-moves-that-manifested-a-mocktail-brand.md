## I. How Structure Became the Starting Point of Our Journey

To help my team work smoothly and effectively, I decided to set up four trusted team leads where each lead focused on a specific area: research, strategy, design, and writing. Each team lead managed two to three members within their own group and they reported directly to me. The small visual here represents that structure and shows how our leadership and accountability were organized throughout the project. It gives a clear sense of how communication flowed and how we all stayed aligned on the Brand Team.

The image on the left shows our Notion Kanban board, which captures how we managed our workflow throughout the project. It helped each team member see what stage their tasks were in, what was coming next for them, and how their tasks ultimately fit into the project goals. The final image shows our team meeting together on Zoom for our daily stand-ups. Our team meetings were a big part of how we all stayed connected, supported each other, and kept our team's momentum moving forward.

The organizational system I established helped reduce bottlenecks, improved how the team leads communicated with each other, and created a dependable system for accountability. These images capture how structure and communication worked hand in hand on our team. Each of the four leads communicated directly with me through Slack and 2 minute daily agenda's on our Zoom calls, and through that rhythm of connection and clarity, our team stayed organized, accountable, and unified. This system kept us all on track and working together smoothly in a fast-paced and often chaotic Agile workflow.

## II. Steering the Team Through Creative Crossroads

While my team leads took care of their respective areas, I stepped in during critical moments to help guide strategy that matched our brand vision and our clients' objectives. I knew there were moments where leadership meant stepping into the creative process and leading by example. One of these moments came when our design team needed direction on the visual identity of the brand.

At first, our team explored a medieval look, but I helped steer our direction toward the tarot-inspired brand identity. As a result of the transition, I ended up working closely with the design team and helped review assets as they came together, including the logo, color palette, and typography hierarchy. I wanted to make sure that the visuals met not only the brand vision but also the quality standards we set as a team before they were rolled out across all teams.

The image shown here is the Elements and Versions page from the Saga V Brand Guidelines. The image shows the approved logo variations and the refined tarot-inspired details that emerged through my collaboration with the design team. The image shows how the original logo evolved into a tarot inspired logo that feels symbolic. By teaming up with the designers during this phase, I helped shape a unified visual identity that connected our design system across content, packaging, and web materials.

By stepping in at critical moments and offering creative guidance, I helped our team align strategy and design, along with building a brand identity that truly told our story with clarity.

## III. Holding the Line Through the Storm

We faced some unexpected obstacles along the way. Early in the project, I fought for my design team to own the illustrations because illustrations belong to brand strategy. I believed they were essential to building the visual storytelling of Saga V. While it took effort to make that case, we eventually lost the battle. The illustration process had stretched our timeline too far, and the packaging team needed to move forward. Our creative director decided to pull the illustration concepts, which was a major blow to the brand team that had worked so hard to bring those ideas to life.

As the project manager, it was incredibly difficult for me to accept the decision made by the creative director. But it was out of my control, and it was even more challenging for me to communicate that decision with my team. Every team member poured their own time, creativity, and pride into their tasks. But when I delivered the news, I just knew I had to approach the situation with compassion. I felt that my team needed to see that I understood the weight of our loss and that it also mattered to me. I wanted my team to know that I was with them in the disappointment, not above it as a project manager.

Once we had acknowledged and accepted the setback, I then shifted into leading second. It was time to rally our team and bring our focus back to what we could control. I simply reminded everyone that this is a part of working within an Agile team. This happens all the time in the real world, when your work doesn't see the light of day. But it's important to learn how to adapt, stay flexible, and to keep ourselves moving forward even when the plans change. I believe by keeping the lines open and maintaining trust in my team, we all stayed aligned, supported, and productive.

The Fool side-by-side illustrations capture this moment visually. The unused concept and the final approved illustration show the shift in direction that our team had to accept and adapt to. This image serves as a reminder that our creativity often involves letting go, and that leadership means guiding a team through these difficult moments with empathy, honesty, and focus. Even through that storm, our team never lost our unity or momentum.

## IV. Anchoring the Vision Within Boundaries

The image above serves as a metaphor for this stage of our project. It shows our team’s early concept boards encased in plastic, representing how focus within boundaries kept us aligned to our goals. The nature of this project was chaotic. Within the brand team alone, we had four separate teams working simultaneously together. Outside our team, there were three more teams moving in parallel. That meant a lot of coordination, communication, and alignment across groups.

I collaborated closely with our creative director and three project managers while managing a team of fourteen members across these cross-functional teams. Throughout the project, I prioritized keeping my team focused on our goals and deadlines while being mindful of everyone's project expectations. I found myself managing expectations often, helping team members understand the difference between what we wanted and what was realistic for our timeline.

To help stay organized throughout the project, I relied heavily on visual and strategic tools such as Kanban boards, the MosCow Method, Affinity Maps, and Notion tables. These tools helped the team see exactly what needed to be done, what was next, and what could wait. They became essential to maintaining alignment across all teams, coordinating dependencies, and avoiding scope creep.

There were times I had to make difficult decisions when the timeline could not support additional features or creative ideas. I knew that was hard for some team members to accept, but it was part of staying anchored to the vision and within the boundaries we had agreed upon. My role was to lead with consistency, communicate clearly, and trust the process.

By using these methods and staying transparent, our team stayed grounded, productive, and united. We kept momentum through the chaos by honoring the balance between creativity and constraint.

## V. Manifesting Results While Nurturing Potential

The images here show the final results of our work: the Saga V Brand Guidelines and the packaging design for the Saga V The Sun product. The brand guidelines book displays the title cover, scalable typography, and color palette pages. The packaging design showcases how the brand identity was applied in a real-world context. Although I did not create the packaging myself, I included the packaging to help highlight the unified brand identity that the brand team helped shape. The alignment between both images reflects the success of our process. The brand identity is cohesive, intentional, and seamless across every medium, which is a win in my book.

Most importantly, our team delivered all of our tasks and deliverables on time and within scope. No deadlines were missed, and our team thrived even in the chaos. When challenges appeared, our team stepped in for each other without hesitation. That kind of mutual support and accountability became our teams greatest strengths. As a whole, our team stayed focused on our objectives and we were stating to trust one another, and we kept our momentum even after the blow to illustrations and never lost sight of the bigger picture.

These images remind us that teamwork extends beyond simply achieving goals. It encompasses collaboration, growth, and learning together through every challenge. This project reinforced my beliefs about leadership: when I lead with trust, empathy, resilience, integrity, and clarity, I create an environment where people can do their best work and reach their full potential.

### Lessons Drawn From the Journey

This project reminded me that I am at my best when I am working and collaborating within a team. There is nothing quite like sharing goals and celebrating success together because when our team wins, we all win. I have learned to appreciate the strength of organized workflows and clear communication because they keep everyone aligned and accountable.

I now understand the value of clarity in leadership. When team roles are clear and tasks are thoughtfully delegated to team members, it helps all of us to stay focused and motivated.

Through this project, I learned that trusting myself and my team while staying diligent with the Agile process made all the difference. By iterating and staying on course, we were able to overcome obstacles and produce our deliverables successfully on time and within scope. The process worked because we stayed patient, diligent, and aligned to the goal.

Looking ahead, I plan to carry these lessons forward as I continue to grow as a team leader and project manager. I look forward to managing larger teams and aligning teams throughout the Agile process. This entire experience has shaped and molded me to become a disciplined leader who leads with trust, communication, and collaboration. I have demonstrated that I can lead teams while being a servant leader, efficient, and delivering bold results.
